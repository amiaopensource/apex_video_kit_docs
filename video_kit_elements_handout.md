## Time Base Corrector (TBC)
The "heartbeat" of the video digitization system, the Time Base Corrector (or TBC for short) is important stabalizing the video signal during the transfer process. The TBC can also correct for some processing errors inherent to the original analog video signal, including compenating for minor droouts. With a TBC, one can also make adjustments to the video signal (and also the audio signal depending on the TBC), including adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, and saturation. Making these signal adjustments with a TBC can help ensure the values of the video signal are within legal broadcast range. 

## Distribution Amplifier
A distriubtion amplifier can send the same single video input to multiple locations simultaneously. For example, using a distribution amplifier, one can view a video on a monitor screen while also sending the same signal to a capture card for digitization. Regardless of how many places the signal is going, it will retain its strength and quality in each piece of equipment. 

## Capture Card
This is where the magic happens! The capture card is the device that converts the video and audio signals from analog waves to digital information. There are different types of capture cards available that can work with different kinds of computers and software.

## Direct Box
A direct box is used to convert unbalanced audio (such as from an RCA connection) to balanced left and right audio (such as from an XLR connection) for higher quality recordings. Depending on what kind of deck you are using to digitize and whether or not it is professional or consumer-grade, you may not need to use a direct box. If your deck has XLR outputs, a direct box is not necessary. If your deck only has RCA audio outputs, then it is recommended to use a direct box to create a balanced audio signal.
