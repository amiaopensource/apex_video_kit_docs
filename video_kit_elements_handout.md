## Time Base Corrector (TBC)
The "heartbeat" of the video digitization system, the Time Base Corrector (or TBC for short) is important stabalizing the video signal during the transfer process. The TBC can also correct for some processing errors inherent to the original analog video signal, including compenating for minor droouts. With a TBC, one can also make adjustments to the video signal (and also the audio signal depending on the TBC), including adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, and saturation. Making these signal adjustments with a TBC can help ensure the values of the video signal are within legal broadcast range.
