# Video Digitization Workflow

Written by Eddy Colloton

Last Updated November 2017

## Step 1: What do I have?

* Which formats?
	Is it a VHS tape? Maybe miniDV? Not sure? Check out the Texas Commission on the 	Arts Videotape Identification and Assessment Guide for pictures and descriptions 	of different tapes.

* How much?
	Do you have 10 tapes or 100? Are there 2 minutes on a tape or 120? Many tapes will 	have their max capacity written on them.

* What is it?
	Are the tapes labeled? Is there a list? It’s a good idea to create an inventory of 	the tapes in a spreadsheet as a first step.
