# Digitial Preservation Basics

## Threats to Digital Information

### Data Rot

### Data Loss

### Obsolesence

## Redundant Storage (aka "Backing Up")

### Gold Standard for Redundant Storage
3 identical copies, in three geographically separated locations, on different types of storage media

## Checksums
### What is a Checksum?
A checksum is like a file's fingerprint. If one bit of the file changes, the checksum will change dramatically

### Why create Checksums?
### Checksum Algorithms


## File Naming and Directory Structure

### Why are File Naming and Directory Structure Important?
If a particular file cannot be located within the filesystem or if future users cannot figure out what a file represents its as good as lost.

### Best Practices for File Naming 
The most important aspect of file naming is that every file should have unique ID. 

### Best Practices for Directory Structure
A well-thought-out directory structure will be easily understandable by future users. When determining a directory structure, engage in a short thought exercise: "If we all left this organization could future staff still find the files that they need?"

## File Formats

### What to Look for in a File Format
