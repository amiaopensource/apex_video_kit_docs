## Threats to Digital Information

### Data Degredation/Data Rot



### Data Loss

### Obsolescence

## Digital Preservation Strategies

### Redundant Storage (aka "Backing Up")

#### Gold Standard for Redundant Storage
3 identical copies, in three geographically separated locations, on different types of storage media

## Checking the Data Integrity of Files
### What is a Checksum?
A checksum is like a file's fingerprint. If one bit of the file changes, the checksum will change dramatically

### Checksum Algorithms
#### MD5
#### SHA1
#### SHA2 (aka SHA256)


## File Naming and Directory Structure

### Why are File Naming and Directory Structure Important?
If a particular file cannot be located within the filesystem or if future users cannot figure out what a file represents its as good as lost.

### Best Practices for File Naming

### Why is a Choice of File Format Important?
### What to Look for in a File Format
