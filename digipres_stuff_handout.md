Welcome to the world of digital preservation! On a long enough timeline there is no escape from dealing with digital files in archival collections. Whether you find yourself working with born-digital video content or analog material that has been digitized, understanding the principles of digital preservation is key to maintaining an accessible collection and preserving it over the long-term. Digital preservation sometimes requires a different way of thinking that may not seem intuitive to those familiar with preservation practices for analog materials. But not to worry, many of the core principles of preserving non-digital materials still apply to digital.

Institutions that are putting significant amounts of time and money into digitization programs or projects must ensure that the files they receive are well-taken care of. Otherwise, those hard-earned files risk becoming inaccessible (and the digitization process was all for naught). Unlike analog formats such as film and videotape, digital files will not persist through "benign neglect". Data on a hard drive that's left untouched on a shelf for twenty years stands little chance of actually being saved. Digital materials require a series of ongoing maintenance activities if they are to persist over time.

This document will describe the threats to digital information and the strategies that archivists, librarians, and IT professionals have developed to mitigate those threats.

## Quick Tips for Digital Preservation 
1. **Keep multiple backup copies of all digital files** (ideally in three copies in three different geographic locations). For more information, see the section on [backing up](https://github.com/amiaopensource/apex_video_kit_docs/blob/master/digipres_stuff_handout.md#redundant-storage-aka-backing-up)
2. **Use a consistent file naming system**. The most important part of a filename is that it should be unique. For more information, see the section on [filenaming and directory structure](https://github.com/amiaopensource/apex_video_kit_docs/blob/master/digipres_stuff_handout.md#file-naming-and-directory-structure).
3. **Store your files in a consistent and easy-to-understand directory structure**. Try to make it as easy to understand as possible, put yourself in the shoes of someone who doesn't work your institution and see if they would be able to figure it out. For more information, see the section on [filenaming and directory structure](https://github.com/amiaopensource/apex_video_kit_docs/blob/master/digipres_stuff_handout.md#file-naming-and-directory-structure).
4. **If possible, create checksums for all files in your collection and check them at regularly scheduled intervals.** This will ensure the integrity of your files. For more information, see the section on [file fixity](https://github.com/amiaopensource/apex_video_kit_docs/blob/master/digipres_stuff_handout.md#checking-the-data-integrity-of-files). 
5. **Use sustainable file formats and monitor formats for obsolescence**. For more information, see the sections on [sustainable file formats](https://github.com/amiaopensource/apex_video_kit_docs/blob/master/digipres_stuff_handout.md#file-formats) and [obsolescence](https://github.com/amiaopensource/apex_video_kit_docs/blob/master/digipres_stuff_handout.md#obsolescence).  

## Threats to Digital Information
Like vinegar syndrome, sticky shed syndrome, and mold, digital information has its own set of risk factors that threaten long-term preservation. 

### Data Degradation/Data Rot
Data degradation, also known as "data rot," occurs when the data in a file changes unintentionally. Some people may also call this phenomenon "file corruption." On a long enough timeline, with a large enough set of data, bits within the stored files may "flip." In other words, one bit of a file changes from the originalâ€”a bit that was originally a 0 becomes a 1, or a 1 becomes a 0. There are many possible reasons for this, including read/write errors with hard drives or other storage devices or the physical decay of the storage device; some even suggest that ![cosmic rays can flip bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_error#Cosmic_rays_creating_energetic_neutrons_and_protons).

So, why does it matter that a single bit in a file has flipped? First, from an archival perspective, the file is no longer the original, the zeros and ones that make up the file have fundamentally changed. There are also practical concerns. In a video file a single flipped bit may never even be noticeable to a viewer. However, that depends on where the bit was flipped. The image below shows how one flipped bit can potentially cause glitches in an image. In the worst case scenario, a flipped bit in the header of a video file may render the file unplayable.

### Obsolescence
Even if exact copies of digital files are kept intact, there is no guarantee that contemporary computer systems will be able to read and properly render these files. In digital preservation there are two kinds of obsolescence to consider: the obsolescence of storage media and the obsolescence of file formats.

#### Storage Media Obsolescence
Storage media refers to the physical carriers on which data is stored. These could be hard drives, floppy disks, optical discs, or even punch cards.  Consider this example: how would you go about transferring data contained on computer punch cards onto your brand new laptop? While this isn't impossible, it would be quite a challenge. From time to time, individual companies have created their own specialized storage media and when the company goes out of business or the format becomes unpopular it may be difficult to find drives to read that media. For example, how people have Iomega Zip disk drives on their current computers? How many even have CD/DVD drives? Storage media on computer systems changes all the time and often older storage media is not compatible with newer systems and digital preservationists must account for this inconvenient situation.

#### File Format Obsolescence
Consider how quickly computing technology has progressed in the last few decades. Different computer programs that were popular in 1995 have now fallen into obscurity. Perhaps these programs had their own file formats that cannot be read by newer programs. Did you ever design a greeting card in Print Shop Deluxe, write a document in WordPerfect, or create a spreadsheet in Lotus 1-2-3? How would you go about accessing these files today? 

Digital preservationists must monitor consider the file formats they acquire for their collections and monitor the file formats they already have in their collections. Understanding the characteristics of file formats helps an individual chose the best target formats and understand the risks related to less sustainable formats and plan for them. 

### Data Loss
Data loss may refer to catastrophic events that could destroy physical equipment like computers, servers, or hard drives. Data deletion or data modification could also be the result of malicious hacking. Just as a flood, hurricane, or tornado could destroy collection materials like books and paper, these natural disasters can impact the safety of data as well if proper measures are not taken. 

Libraries, museums, and archives typically have measures for protecting their physical materials in the event of a disaster. However, every cultural heritage institution must also consider its digital components in its disaster plan. Institutions may need to consider their network security protocols and the security of their digital files as well. How well are the computers where you store your files protected from natural disasters? How secure are these computer and storage systems?

## Digital Preservation Strategies
The following strategies respond to the threats outlined above. Following these strategies allows cultural heritage institutions to store data safely for the long haul.

### Redundant Storage (aka "Backing Up")
Perhaps the single greatest advantage of materials is the abilty to make an infinite number of copies with 100% fidelity to the original. It's kind of like their superpower. One of the most effective actions archivists can take when trying to preserve digital files is to make multiple exact copies. Taking this step can mitigate both bit flipping and catatrosphic data loss. Backing up is a powerful preservation measure. 

#### Best Practice for Redundant Storage
Keeping three identical copies of files, in three geographically separated locations is considered best practice. This course of action prevents a situation where a natual disaster destroys all copies of a collection item. Ideally the three copies should be stored on different types of media. For example, one copy of a file could be stored on a spinning disk hard drive (HDD), one copy on a solid state drive (SSD), and yet another on an LTO data tape.

## Checking the Data Integrity of Files
Intergrity (or fixity) checks are periodic attempts to determine if a copy of a file is an exact copy, or if the bits of a file have changed over time. In order to accomplish this feat, specialized values called "checksums" (also sometimes called " hashes") are used to compare files.

### What is a Checksum?
A checksum is an algorithm (a series of mathematical and logical operations) that calculates a unique alphanumeric value based on the contents of a file. A checksum is a little like a file's fingerprint, however, it is event more unqiue than a fingerprint. If one bit of the file changes, the checksum will change dramatically as in the image below:

### Why create Checksums?
When an archive receives a new file it should immediately create a checksum for that file (assuming one hasn't already been created). Once the checksum has been identified, it can be used as an important reference for the life of the file. If copies of the file are made they can be compared against the checksum. If the copy produces the same checksum as the original file, the two files are identical. 

The original file can also be checked over time. The same file should always produce the same checksum if its contents have not changed.   

### Checksum Algorithms
Knowing which algorithm produced a checksum is critical. Future checksum verification requires using the same algorithm to get the same result. Two checksum algorithms currently in use by archives are MD5 (Message Digest 5) and SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1). An MD5 checksum is significantly faster to calculate. However, there is a trade off. A checksum collision (two files with different data producing the exact same checksum) is more likely with MD5 than with SHA-1.

### Scheduling Fixity Checks
Collecting and storing the data about fixity checks over time ensures the authenticity of the file. With this information, the archive can prove an unbroken chain of custody. By collecting regular fixity data they can prove that a file sitting on their storage system in 2050 is exactly the same as the file they received from its creator in 2017. 

## File Naming and Directory Structure
Files that cannot be found in a filesystem are as good as lost. Additionally, if archivists and researchers cannot understand the context of the file  (for example which hard drive a file came from) it's also as good as lost. In order to prevent this situation from happening, archivists must create unique filenames within an easy-to-understand directory stucture.

### Best Practices for File Naming 
The most important aspect of file naming is that every file should have a unique identifier. In other words, no two filenames should be alike. In addition, special charcters such as @,#,$,%,&,\*, and + should be avoided in filenames. Particularly in Windows operating systems, these filenames can cause issues. The safest filenames use either all numbers, all lowercase letters, and use underscores or hyphens instead of spaces.  

### Best Practices for Directory Structure
A well-thought-out directory structure will be easily understandable by future users. When determining a directory structure, engage in a short thought exercise: "If we all left this organization, could future staff still find the files that they need?"

## File Formats
Choice of file formats can have a big impact on future preservation decisions for digital files. For organizations that get their collections digitized, they should think carefully about the target format they are digitizing to. For organizations that collect born-digital content they should assess the formats that they have to plan for future preservation actions.

Wise selection of file formats can migitigate against obsolesence issues.

### Compression vs. Lossless Compression vs. No Compression
### What to Look for in a File Format
The basic aspects to consider in file formats are: 
* **Openness** - Does one company control the format (is it proprietary)? Is the format open source? Open source formats may have more of a life than proprietary formats.
* **Documentation** - Is the format well-documented? Are the specifications for how to create a file in the given format easy to find? If these specifications are easy to find thereâ€™s a chance of a programmer building software in the future to read the format. Good documentation also typically means that the format is well-standardized. 
* **Self-descriptiveness** - How good is the formatâ€™s metadata? How well does it describe the playback specifications of the file? Some files have very little technical metadata embedded within them (for example on older video formats the aspect ratio wasnâ€™t specified so the video player would just guess at how to present the file). In general, more technical metadata within a file is better. Technical metadata needs to specify at minimum - framerate, interlacing, aspect ratio, resolution.
* **Universality/Ubiquity** - How universal or ubiquitious is the file format? Is it being used in the real world? Is it being used in the video production world? Does good software out there for encoding/decoding the format?

### File Format Normalization or Migration
