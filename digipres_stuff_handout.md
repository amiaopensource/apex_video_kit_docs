Welcome to the world of digital preservation. Whether you find yourself working with born-digital video content or analog material that has become digital through digitization, understanding the principles of digital preservation is key to maintaining an accessible collection and preserving it long-term. Digital preservation sometimes requires a different way of thinking that may not seem intuitive to those familiar with the preservation practices for analog materials. But not to worry, many of core principles of preserving non-digital materials still apply to digital.

Institutions that are putting significant amounts of time and money into digitization programs or projects must ensure that the files they receive are well-taken care of. Otherwise those hard-earned files can become inaccessible. Unlike analog formats like film and videotape, digital files will not persist through "benign neglect". Data on a hard drive that's left on a shelf for twenty years stands little chance of actually being saved for reasons which will be discussed below. Digital materials require a series of ongoing maintenance activities if they are to persist over time.

This handout will describe the threats to digital information and the strategies that archivists and IT professionals have developed to mitigate those threats.

## Threats to Digital Information

Like vinegar syndrome, sticky shed syndrome, and mold digital information has its own set of factors that threaten long-term preservation. 

### Data Degredation/Data Rot

### Data Loss

### Obsolescence

## Digital Preservation Strategies

### Redundant Storage (aka "Backing Up")

#### Gold Standard for Redundant Storage
3 identical copies, in three geographically separated locations, on different types of storage media

## Checking the Data Integrity of Files

### What is a Checksum?
A checksum is like a file's fingerprint. If one bit of the file changes, the checksum will change dramatically

### Why create Checksums?
### Checksum Algorithms
#### MD5
#### SHA1
#### SHA2 (aka SHA256)

### Scheduling Fixity Checks
Having the data about fixity checks over time ensures the authenticity of the file. With this information, the archive can prove an unbroken chain of custody. By collecting regular fixity data they can prove that the file they have stored in 2050 is exactly the same as the file they received from the creator in 2017. 

## File Naming and Directory Structure
Files that cannot be found in a filesystem are as good as lost. And often in the digital world files that cannot be understood are as good as lost.

If you're putting 

### Why are File Naming and Directory Structure Important?
If a particular file cannot be located within the filesystem or if future users cannot figure out what a file represents its as good as lost.

### Best Practices for File Naming 
The most important aspect of file naming is that every file should have unique ID. 

### Best Practices for Directory Structure
A well-thought-out directory structure will be easily understandable by future users. When determining a directory structure, engage in a short thought exercise: "If we all left this organization could future staff still find the files that they need?"
